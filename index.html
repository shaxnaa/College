        <h1>            Late Sri Ammembal Subba Rao Pai</h1>
     
        <p>“He was a man, take him all in all, I shall not look upon his like again”. An institution grows in the shadow of the founder. It was on 19th November 1852, a legend christened Ammembal Subba Rao Pai was born at Mulky near Mangaluru. This star went ahead and created a universe of its own which emanates radiance in the form of talented individuals and shall continue to emanate this radiance for time immemorial.
        His concern for social uplift gave birth in 1891 of the Canara High School, Mangaluru, the century old precursor to the conglomeration of Canara Educational Institutions of today; while his spirit of enterprise gave birth to yet another national institution, the Canara Bank, in 1906.
        Sri Subba Rao’s versatility was not confined to the legal profession alone. Along with his professional work in the mornings, the evenings were devoted to social work. He kept himself fully informed about the fast changing world.Because of his enormous efforts, our young men were seen holding high offices both in the Engineering and Medical services at then.
        The seeds sown by our founder more than a century ago have grown into huge tree providing shelter to the society in terms of education, employment opportunities and financial support; thus contributing to the welfare, prosperity and progress of the society. </p>
